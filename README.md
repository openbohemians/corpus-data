Corpus Data
===========

This project provides texts and lexicon data for use by the various Corpus implementations.

All of the texts have been sourced from open sources. Unfortunately this tends to mean that
the texts are somehwhat dated. However, this doesn't to appear to have caused any significant
skewing of the analysis. Apparently the mainstay of language use is pretty stable.

The data is divided into three parts.

* corpus - a large body of texts to use for final analysis
* sample - a very small sample of texts for testing purposes
* lexion - various word lists in alphabetical order
