This is an abstract corpus entry, so that certain words will be added to the
corpus that might not normally be added.

One set of words in particular that are difficult to find in readily available 
corpus material are acronyms. So lets provide some examples for common acronyms
and see how far they get.


Acronyms
--------

Keeping up with the latest online lingo is tough. If SMH, TBH, or FOMO don’t ring a bell, you better read on to figure out what the hell people are saying in cyberspace these days.

AFAIK means "As Far As I Know". AFAIK is a common acronym, AFAIK. Of course, AFAIK you already know this.

ASAP means "As Soon As Possible." For example, "I will do it ASAP." ASAP is a common and old acronym.

AWK means "Awkward". Used by self-conscious liberal arts students, and parrots whose owners are too lazy to teach them to talk.

BB is a vaguely condescending term of affection, short for "baby" --the sort of thing said by a girl who’s not going to sleep with you because she really values your friendship.

BFF means "Best Friends Forever". e.g. "She's my BFF." or "My BFF and I ..."

BRB stands for "Be Right Back". As in, "BRB Sexy."

BTW means "By the Way." Alternatively, you can say "BT dubs," but you’ll just end up sounding like a 13-year-old girl. e.g. "BTW have you seen the new movie?" and "BTW there is a new Superman movie out."

DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid. DNA is the material the makes up biological genes.

FOMO means "Fear of Missing Out". Used mostly by Type A startup entrepreneurs, like Anil Dash and Caterina Fake, who came up with the abbreviations.

FWIW means "For What It's Worth", e.g. "FWIW I believe you."

FYI means "For Your Information". e.g. "FYI I will be there next week." And, "FYI It's not that simple." FYI is generally used to start a message and is short way of saying, "just so you know".

GIF stands for "Graphics Interchange Format," which allows for a limited moving image, like a repeating moment from a movie. Once just the territory of "Saved by the Bell" memes, they’re now used by high-end publications like The Atlantic Wire.

HTH means "Hope That Helps". HTH is a way to end a message expressing a hope that the message was helpful.

IANAL means "I Am Not A Lawyer". IANAL so don't take my word for it.

ICYMI means "In Case You Missed It." Example: ICYMI, I started using frivolous acronyms.

IIRC means "If I Recall Correctly". As in "IIRC you were wearing one red shoe."

IOU means "I Owe You". "IOU twenty bucks".

IRL means "In Real Life" — meaning not on the Internet, where most of us secretly prefer spending most of our time. After all, you can't just sign off 10 minutes into getting a drink with that dude you kind of knew in college. Sorry, Brad, you just don’t make me lol IRL.

JPG or JPEG is the most common compressed picture format, used by all digital cameras.

JOMO means "Joy of Missing Out". See FOMO above.

LOL means "Laugh Out Loud". As in "That was LOL funny."

LMAO means "Laughing My Ass Off". For example, is you found a picture or comment to be very funny
you might respond with "LMAO".

NP means "No Problem." Used by people whose mothers never taught them to say thank you (or ty).

OMG means "Oh, My God." OMG OMG OMG!

OTOH means "On The Other Hand." People use OTOH to offer an opposite opinion to the one they just gave. For example, "It could be fun. OTOH We might get in trouble."

QED is used to end a proof. QED stands for "Quod Erat Demonstrandum". It is Latin.

ROTF means "Rolling on the Floor." When LOL just isn’t enough.

The term RSVP comes from the French expression "répondez s'il vous plaît", meaning "please respond". If RSVP is written on an invitation it means the invited guest must tell the host whether or not they plan to attend the party. RSVP does not mean to respond only if you're coming, and it does not mean respond only if you're not coming (the expression "regrets only" is reserved for that instance). RSVP means the host needs a definite head count for the planned event, and needs it by the date specified on the invitation.

SMH means "Shaking My Head," an expression of disbelief or disapproval. Example: My colleague just showed up to work in a mesh shirt. SMH

SNAFU means "Situation Normal, All Fowled Up." Yea, SNAFU SNAFU SNAFU.

TBH means "To Be Honest". TBH is an expression used to say 'I am being extra candid by saying this' or 'I am going to admit a weakness or partial failure on my part by saying this'.

TBH means "To Be Honest." Used similarly to IMHO, which extends out to "In My Honest Opinion." Example: TBH, the thought of Mitt Romney dressed as a polar bear kind of turns me on.

TBT means "Throwback Thursday." Usually used as a hashtag on Instagram and Twitter. #tbt is a chance to take a break from posting pictures of things that just happened.

TGIF is an ellated expression meaning, "Thank Goodness It's Friday." TGIF is frequenently used in all workplaces in anticipation of the weekend.

TTFN means "Ta Ta For Now." TTFN is said frequently by Tiger because he's the only one. TTFN.

WTF means "What the Fuck". WTF is a blunt expression of shock and concerned confusion. Somewhat like OMG, WTF is used when an alarming event just occurred, or some unexpected and disturbing news was just conveyed.

WYSIWYG means "What You See Is What You Get". WYSIWYG is a commonly used in reference to program interfaces, as in "A good word processor is WYSIWYG, whereas a text editor is not".

XOXO is used to designate "hugs and kisses". The X's in XOXO stand for a kiss, and the O's stand for a hug. XOXO is generally used to end a message to a loved one, as in "XOXO My Love".

YMMV means "Your Milage May Vary." YMMV is used to let others know that what has been demonstrated might not work as well for them, usually because of subjective matters. YMMV.

YOLO means "You Only Live Once." Coined by hip-hop star and unabashed nana-lover Drake, meaning that you should take risks and live life to the fullest — because if Steve Jobs couldn’t cheat death, the rest of us are probably screwed.
